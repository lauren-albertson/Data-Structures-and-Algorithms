# Data Structures and Algorithms

## About
* This open source project is meant to serve as a collection of different implementations of varying Data Structures and Algorithms for students to utilize. All of the  code written in C++/C, and thus the implementations of the data structures and algorithms are meant to be used in code written in C++/C.

## Contributions
* This repository is open for contributions, so if there is any missing data structures, feel free to add them. Ensure that all code is written in C/C++ for continuity purposes.


## Compiling and Running
* To compile and run the code, either download the files or copy/paste the source code into your IDE/compiler. After that, you may run the code as you would any other .cpp file.

## Conditions for Contributions
1. Make sure you test all the edge cases before you make a PR
2. Write comments so that other students can understand what is being done in the code.
